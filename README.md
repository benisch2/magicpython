# magicpython
A Python-Based RPG - v. 0.0
'''
So I've never really posted any kind of projects to github before, but I decided I should probably start.
That way I can work on my stuff across devices.

Anyway, this is going to be a game called MAGIC PYTHON, a game where you become a Witch or Wizard in standard
RPG fashion and go to save the world or defeat the demon king.

It's more of an exercise in me learning python than anything else, but it will also be a good opportunity for me to learn
python on my own time while also doing something fun.

Eventually I may add support for other classes, but the only classes I tend to care about in RPGs are the magic
classes so I will spend the bulk of my time initially on this.
